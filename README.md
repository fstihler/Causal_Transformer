# Causal_Transformer
Multimodal Causal Transformer (Text and Image Generation)

This project involves the development and training of a multimodal autoregressive transformer model capable of handling and generating both text and image data. Using the Colored MNIST v2 dataset with paired text-image descriptions, the model processes sequences combining text and image tokens in flexible orders.
